TI  - Ibrutinib Regimens versus Chemoimmunotherapy in Older Patients with Untreated CLL.
PG  - 2517-2528
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1812836 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the 
      treatment of patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) since 2016 
      but has not been compared with chemoimmunotherapy. We conducted a phase 3 trial to 
      evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib, either alone or in combination with rituximab, 
      relative to chemoimmunotherapy. METHODS: Patients 65 years of age or older who had 
      untreated CLL were randomly assigned to receive bendamustine plus rituximab, 
      ibrutinib, or ibrutinib plus rituximab. The primary end point was progression-free 
      survival. The Alliance Data and Safety Monitoring Board made the decision to release 
      the data after the protocol-specified efficacy threshold had been met. RESULTS: A 
      total of 183 patients were assigned to receive bendamustine plus rituximab, 182 to 
      receive ibrutinib, and 182 to receive ibrutinib plus rituximab. Median 
      progression-free survival was reached only with bendamustine plus rituximab. The 
      estimated percentage of patients with progression-free survival at 2 years was 74% 
      with bendamustine plus rituximab and was higher with ibrutinib alone (87%; hazard 
      ratio for disease progression or death, 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 
      0.58; P<0.001) and with ibrutinib plus rituximab (88%; hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 
      0.25 to 0.59; P<0.001). There was no significant difference between the 
      ibrutinib-plus-rituximab group and the ibrutinib group with regard to 
      progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.62; P=0.49). With a 
      median follow-up of 38 months, there was no significant difference among the three 
      treatment groups with regard to overall survival. The rate of grade 3, 4, or 5 
      hematologic adverse events was higher with bendamustine plus rituximab (61%) than 
      with ibrutinib or ibrutinib plus rituximab (41% and 39%, respectively), whereas the 
      rate of grade 3, 4, or 5 nonhematologic adverse events was lower with bendamustine 
      plus rituximab (63%) than with the ibrutinib-containing regimens (74% with each 
      regimen). CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with untreated CLL, treatment with 
      ibrutinib was superior to treatment with bendamustine plus rituximab with regard to 
      progression-free survival. There was no significant difference between ibrutinib and 
      ibrutinib plus rituximab with regard to progression-free survival. (Funded by the

TI  - BTK(C481S)-Mediated Resistance to Ibrutinib in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
PG  - 1437-1443
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2016.70.2282 [doi]
AB  - Purpose Therapeutic targeting of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) with ibrutinib in 
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia has led to a paradigm shift in therapy, and relapse has 
      been uncommon with current follow-up. Acquired mutations in BTK and PLCG2 can cause 
      relapse, but data regarding the prevalence and natural history of these mutations 
      are limited. Patients and Methods Patients accrued to four sequential studies of 
      ibrutinib were included in these analyses. Deep sequencing for BTK and PLCG2 was 
      performed retrospectively on patients who experienced relapse and prospectively on a 
      screening population. Results With a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, the 
      estimated cumulative incidence of progression at 4 years is 19% (95% CI, 14% to 
      24%). Baseline karyotypic complexity, presence of del(17)(p13.1), and age less than 
      65 years were risk factors for progression. Among patients who experienced relapse, 
      acquired mutations of BTK or PLCG2 were found in 85% (95% CI, 71% to 94%), and these 
      mutations were detected an estimated median of 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 11.7 
      months) before relapse. Of a group of 112 patients examined prospectively, eight 
      patients have experienced relapse, and all of these patients had acquired resistance 
      mutations before relapse. A resistance mutation was detected in an additional eight 
      patients who have not yet met criteria for clinical relapse. Conclusion Relapse of 
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia after ibrutinib is an issue of increasing clinical 
      significance. We show that mutations in BTK and PLCG2 appear early and have the 
      potential to be used as a biomarker for future relapse, suggesting an opportunity 
      for intervention.

      cell leukemia.
PG  - 553-560
LID - 10.1182/blood-2016-01-689422 [doi]
AB  - Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon hematologic malignancy characterized by 
      pancytopenia and marked susceptibility to infection. Tremendous progress in the 
      management of patients with this disease has resulted in high response rates and 
      improved survival, yet relapse and an appropriate approach to re-treatment present 
      continuing areas for research. The disease and its effective treatment are 
      associated with immunosuppression. Because more patients are being treated with 
      alternative programs, comparison of results will require general agreement on 
      definitions of response, relapse, and methods of determining minimal residual 
      disease. The development of internationally accepted, reproducible criteria is of 
      paramount importance in evaluating and comparing clinical trials to provide optimal 
      care. Despite the success achieved in managing these patients, continued 
      participation in available clinical trials in the first-line and particularly in the 
      relapse setting is highly recommended. The Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation convened 
      an international conference to provide common definitions and structure to guide 
      current management. There is substantial opportunity for continued research in this 
      disease. In addition to the importance of optimizing the prevention and management 
      of the serious risk of infection, organized evaluations of minimal residual disease 
      and treatment at relapse offer ample opportunities for clinical research. Finally, a 
      scholarly evaluation of quality of life in the increasing number of survivors of 
      this now manageable chronic illness merits further study. The development of 
      consensus guidelines for this disease offers a framework for continued enhancement 
      of the outcome for patients.

LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-0209 [doi]
AB  - Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a nonmutated therapeutic target in acute myeloid 
      leukemia (AML). Attempts to exploit SYK therapeutically in AML have shown promising 
      results in combination with chemotherapy, likely reflecting induced mechanisms of 
      resistance to single-agent treatment in vivo. We conducted a genome-scale open 
      reading frame (ORF) resistance screen and identified activation of the RAS-MAPK-ERK 
      pathway as one major mechanism of resistance to SYK inhibitors. This finding was 
      validated in AML cell lines with innate and acquired resistance to SYK inhibitors. 
      Furthermore, patients with AML with select mutations activating these pathways 
      displayed early resistance to SYK inhibition. To circumvent SYK inhibitor therapy 
      resistance in AML, we demonstrate that a MEK and SYK inhibitor combination is 
      synergistic in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide justification for use of ORF 
      screening to identify resistance mechanisms to kinase inhibitor therapy in AML 
      lacking distinct mutations and to direct novel combination-based strategies to 
      abrogate these. SIGNIFICANCE: The integration of functional genomic screening with 
      the study of mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance in model systems and 
      human patients identified resistance to SYK inhibitors through MAPK signaling in 
      AML. The dual targeting of SYK and the MAPK pathway offers a combinatorial strategy 
      to overcome this resistance.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous and complex disease, and treatments 
      for this disease have not been curative for the majority of patients. In younger 
      patients, internal tandem duplication of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) is a common mutation for 
      which two inhibitors (midostaurin and gilteritinib) with varied potency and 
      specificity for FLT3 are clinically approved. However, the high rate of relapse or 
      failed initial response of AML patients suggests that the addition of a second 
      targeted therapy may be necessary to improve efficacy. Using an unbiased large-scale 
      CRISPR screen, we genetically identified BCL2 knockout as having synergistic effects 
      with an approved FLT3 inhibitor. Here, we provide supportive studies that validate 
      the therapeutic potential of the combination of FLT3 inhibitors with venetoclax in 
      vitro and in vivo against multiple models of FLT3-ITD-driven AML. Our unbiased 
      approach provides genetic validation for co-targeting FLT3 and BCL2 and repurposes 
      CRISPR screening data, utilizing the genome-wide scope toward mechanistic 
      understanding.

TI  - Acalabrutinib plus Obinutuzumab in Treatment-Naïve and Relapsed/Refractory Chronic 
      Lymphocytic Leukemia.
PG  - 394-405
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-1130 [doi]
AB  - Acalabrutinib is a selective irreversible Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor 
      that does not affect IL2-associated tyrosine kinase or antibody-dependent cellular 
      cytotoxicity, making it an attractive candidate for combination therapy with 
      anti-CD20 antibodies. We investigated acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab in a phase 
      Ib/II study (NCT02296918) of patients with treatment-naïve or relapsed/refractory 
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nineteen treatment-naïve and 26 
      relapsed/refractory patients were treated with acalabrutinib (100 mg twice daily) 
      until progression and obinutuzumab (cycle 1: 100 mg day 1, 900 mg day 2, 1000 mg 
      days 8 and 15; cycles 2-6: 1,000 mg day 1). Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 71% 
      of patients. Overall response rates were 95% (treatment-naïve) and 92% 
      (relapsed/refractory). Thirty-two percent of treatment-naïve and 8% of 
      relapsed/refractory patients achieved complete remission. At 36 months, 94% 
      (treatment-naïve) and 88% (relapsed/refractory) were progression free. Acalabrutinib 
      plus obinutuzumab was well tolerated, producing high and durable responses in 
      treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory CLL. SIGNIFICANCE: Rituximab plus the less 
      selective BTK inhibitor ibrutinib has not shown benefit in CLL; however, the 
      selective BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib plus the antibody-dependent cellular 
      cytotoxicity-enhanced antibody obinutuzumab yielded durable responses that deepened 
      over time in treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory CLL, supporting the evaluation 
      of this approach in larger, comparative studies in CLL.This article is highlighted 
      in the In This Issue feature, p. 327.

TI  - Mutational landscape and clinical outcome of patients with de novo acute myeloid 
      leukemia and rearrangements involving 11q23/KMT2A.
PG  - 26340-26346
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2014732117 [doi]
AB  - Balanced rearrangements involving the KMT2A gene, located at 11q23, are among the 
      most frequent chromosome aberrations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because of 
      numerous fusion partners, the mutational landscape and prognostic impact of specific 
      11q23/KMT2A rearrangements are not fully understood. We analyzed clinical features 
      of 172 adults with AML and recurrent 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements, 141 of whom had 
      outcome data available. We compared outcomes of these patients with outcomes of 
      1,097 patients without an 11q23/KMT2A rearrangement categorized according to the 
      2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification. Using targeted next-generation 
      sequencing, we investigated the mutational status of 81 leukemia/cancer-associated 
      genes in 96 patients with 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements with material for molecular 
      studies available. Patients with 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements had a low number of 
      additional gene mutations (median, 1; range 0 to 6), which involved the RAS pathway 
      (KRAS, NRAS, and PTPN11) in 32% of patients. KRAS mutations occurred more often in 
      patients with t(6;11)(q27;q23)/KMT2A-AFDN compared with patients with the other 
      11q23/KMT2A subsets. Specific gene mutations were too infrequent in patients with 
      specific 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements to assess their associations with outcomes. We 
      demonstrate that younger (age <60 y) patients with t(9;11)(p22;q23)/KMT2A-MLLT3 had 
      better outcomes than patients with other 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements and those 
      without 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements classified in the 2017 ELN intermediate-risk 
      group. Conversely, outcomes of older patients (age ≥60 y) with t(9;11)(p22;q23) were 
      poor and comparable to those of the ELN adverse-risk group patients. Our study shows 
      that patients with an 11q23/KMT2A rearrangement have distinct mutational patterns 
      and outcomes depending on the fusion partner.

TI  - Additional gene mutations may refine the 2017 European LeukemiaNet classification in 
      adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia aged <60 years.
PG  - 3215-3227

AB  - The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations for diagnosis and management of acute 
      myeloid leukemia (AML) have become an important tool to assess patients' prognosis 
      and guide treatment. We tested the prognostic impact of the 2017 ELN classification 
      in a large cohort of 863 AML patients aged <60 years similarly treated on Cancer and 
      Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology studies. Based on 
      multivariable models within each ELN genetic-risk group, we identified additional 
      gene mutations that may refine the 2017 ELN risk classification. BCOR- or 
      SETBP1-mutated favorable-risk patients with non-core-binding factor AML and 
      IDH-mutated adverse-risk patients had intermediate-risk outcomes. Outcomes of 
      NPM1/WT1 co-mutated patients and those of ZRSR2-mutated patients resembled outcome 
      of adverse-risk patients. Moreover, FLT3-ITD(high) allelic ratio conferred adverse 
      rather than intermediate-risk irrespective of the NPM1 mutation status, and DNMT3A 
      mutations associated with very poor survival. Application of these refinements 
      reclassified 9% of current favorable-risk patients and 53% of current 
      intermediate-risk patients to the adverse-risk group, with similar poor survival as 
      current adverse-risk patients. Furthermore, 4% of current favorable-risk patients 
      and 9% of adverse-risk patients were reclassified to the intermediate-risk group.

AB  - PURPOSE: Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling is a proposed target in acute 
      myeloid leukemia (AML). Sensitivity to SYK inhibition has been linked to HOXA9 and 
      MEIS1 overexpression in preclinical studies. This trial evaluated the safety and 
      efficacy of entospletinib, a selective inhibitor of SYK, in combination with 
      chemotherapy in untreated AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an international 
      multicenter phase Ib/II study, entospletinib dose escalation (standard 3+3 design 
      between 200 and 400 mg twice daily) + 7+3 (cytarabine + daunorubicin) in phase Ib 
      and entospletinib dose expansion (400 mg twice daily) + 7+3 in phase II. RESULTS: 
      Fifty-three patients (n = 12, phase Ib and n = 41, phase II) with previously 
      untreated de novo (n = 39) or secondary (n = 14) AML were enrolled (58% male; median 
      age, 60 years) in this study. The composite complete response with entospletinib + 
      7+3 was 70%. Patients with baseline HOXA9 and MEIS1 expression higher than the 
      median had improved overall survival compared with patients with below median HOXA9 
      and MEIS1 expression. Common adverse events were cytopenias, febrile neutropenia, 
      and infection. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. Entospletinib-related skin 
      rash and hyperbilirubinemia were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Entospletinib with 
      intensive chemotherapy was well-tolerated in patients with AML. Improved survival 
      was observed in patients with HOXA9/MEIS1 overexpression, contrasting published data 
      demonstrating poor survival in such patients. A randomized study will be necessary 
      to determine whether entospletinib was a mediator this observation.

AB  - MOTIVATION: There are many tools for variant calling and effect prediction, but 
      little to tie together large sample groups. Aggregating, sorting and summarizing 
      variants and effects across a cohort is often done with ad hoc scripts that must be 
      re-written for every new project. In response, we have written MuCor, a tool to 
      gather variants from a variety of input formats (including multiple files per 
      sample), perform database lookups and frequency calculations, and write many types 
      of reports. In addition to use in large studies with numerous samples, MuCor can 
      also be employed to directly compare variant calls from the same sample across two 
      or more platforms, parameters or pipelines. A companion utility, DepthGauge, 
      measures coverage at regions of interest to increase confidence in calls.

PG  - lqaa070

LID - lqaa070
AB  - High-throughput short-read sequencing relies on fragmented DNA for optimal sampling 
      of input nucleic acid. Several vendors now offer proprietary enzyme cocktails as a 
      cheaper and more streamlined method of fragmentation when compared to acoustic 
      shearing. We have discovered that these enzymes induce the formation of library 
      molecules containing regions of nearby DNA from opposite strands. Sequencing reads 
      derived from these molecules can lead to artifact-derived variant calls appearing at 
      variant allele frequencies <5%. We present Fragmentation Artifact Detection and 
      Elimination (FADE), software to remove these artifacts from mapped reads and 
      mitigate artifact-related effects on downstream analysis. We find that the artifacts 
      principally affect downstream analyses that are sensitive to a 1-3% artifact bias in 
      the sequencing reads, such as targeted resequencing and rare variant discovery.

AB  - Detecting, characterizing, and monitoring rare populations of cells can increase 
      testing sensitivity, give insight into disease mechanism, and inform clinical 
      decision making. One area that can benefit from increased resolution is management 
      of cancers in clinical remission but with measurable residual disease (MRD) by 
      multicolor FACS. Detecting and monitoring genomic clonal resistance to treatment in 
      the setting of MRD is technically difficult and resource intensive due to the 
      limited amounts of disease cells. Here, we describe limited-cell FACS sequencing 
      (LC-FACSeq), a reproducible, highly sensitive method of characterizing clonal 
      evolution in rare cells relevant to different types of acute and chronic leukemias. 
      We demonstrate the utility of LC-FACSeq for broad multigene gene panels and its 
      application for monitoring sequential acquisition of mutations conferring therapy 
      resistance and clonal evolution in long-term ibrutinib treatment of patients with 
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This technique is generalizable for monitoring of 
      other blood and marrow infiltrating cancers.

AB  - The field of oncology has been transformed over the course of the last 20 years in 
      large part due to the enhanced understanding of cellular biology and cellular 
      signaling. The indolent natural history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has 
      permitted extensive study of cancer biology and can in some ways be thought of a 
      model for understanding and translating concepts to other diseases. By 
      systematically probing the biology of CLL cells and working out in stepwise fashion 
      the transduction of signals from the surface immunoglobulin to nuclear transcription 
      factors, investigators have paved the way for rational targeting of therapies at 
      natural vulnerabilities that mimic oncogene addiction. These key targets include 
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Src, Bcl2, and 
      cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In this review, we will consider these proteins and 
      describe the current and future molecules designed to target them in CLL.

AB  - Effective treatment for AML is challenging due to the presence of clonal 
      heterogeneity and the evolution of polyclonal drug resistance. Here, we report that 
      TP-0903 has potent activity against protein kinases related to STAT, AKT, and ERK 
      signaling, as well as cell cycle regulators in biochemical and cellular assays. In 
      vitro and in vivo, TP-0903 was active in multiple models of drug-resistant FLT3 
      mutant AML, including those involving the F691L gatekeeper mutation and bone marrow 
      microenvironment-mediated factors. Furthermore, TP-0903 demonstrated preclinical 
      activity in AML models with FLT3-ITD and common co-occurring mutations in IDH2 and 
      NRAS genes. We also showed that TP-0903 had ex vivo activity in primary AML cells 
      with recurrent mutations including MLL-PTD, ASXL1, SRSF2, and WT1, which are 
      associated with poor prognosis or promote clinical resistance to AML-directed 
      therapies. Our preclinical studies demonstrate that TP-0903 is a multikinase 
      inhibitor with potent activity against multiple drug-resistant models of AML that 
      will have an immediate clinical impact in a heterogeneous disease like AML.

AB  - Owing to the marked sexual dimorphism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), sex hormone 
      receptor signaling has been implicated in numerous aspects of liver cancer 
      pathogenesis. We sought to reconcile the clear contribution of androgen receptor 
      (AR) activity that has been established in preclinical models of HCC with the 
      clinical failure of AR antagonists in patients with advanced HCC by evaluating 
      potential resistance mechanisms to AR-targeted therapy. The AR locus was 
      interrogated for resistance-causing genomic modifications using publicly available 
      primary HCC datasets (1,019 samples). Analysis of HCC tumor and cell line RNA-seq 
      data revealed enriched expression of constitutively active, treatment-refractory AR 
      splice variants (AR-SV). HCC cell lines expressed C-terminal-truncated AR-SV; 28 
      primary HCC samples abundantly expressed AR-SV. Low molecular weight AR species were 
      nuclear localized and constitutively active. Furthermore, AR/AR-SV signaling 
      promoted AR-mediated HCC cell progression and conferred resistance to AR 
      antagonists. Ligand-dependent and -independent AR signaling mediated HCC 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by regulating the transcription factor SLUG. 
      These data suggest that AR-SV expression in HCC drives HCC progression and 
      resistance to traditional AR antagonists. Novel therapeutic approaches that 
      successfully target AR-SVs may be therapeutically beneficial for HCC. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Treatment-refractory, constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants 
      promote hepatocellular carcinoma progression by regulating the 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathway.

AB  - Abstract As the rational application of targeted therapies in cancer supplants 
      traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, there is an ever-greater need for a thorough 
      understanding of the complex machinery of the cell and an application of this 
      knowledge to the development of novel therapeutics and combinations of agents. Here, 
      we review the current state of knowledge of the class of targeted agents known as 
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, with a focus on chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia (CLL). Flavopiridol (alvocidib) is the best studied of the CDK inhibitors, 
      producing a dramatic cytotoxic effect in vitro and in vivo, with the principal 
      limiting factor of acute tumor lysis. Unfortunately, flavopiridol has a narrow 
      therapeutic window and is relatively non-selective with several off-target (i.e. 
      non-CDK) effects, which prompted development of the second-generation CDK inhibitor 
      dinaciclib. Dinaciclib appears to be both more potent and selective than 
      flavopiridol, with at least an order of magnitude greater therapeutic index, and is 
      currently in phase III clinical trials. In additional to flavopiridol and 
      dinaciclib, we also review the current status of other members of this class, and 
      provide commentary as to the future direction of combination therapy including CDK 
      inhibitors.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are functionally and genetically diverse and this 
      diversity decreases with age and disease. Numerous systems have been developed to 
      quantify HSC diversity by genetic barcoding, but no framework has been established 
      to empirically validate barcode sequences. Here we have developed an analytical 
      framework, Selection of informative Amplicon Barcodes from Experimental Replicates 
      (SABER), that identifies barcodes that are unique among a large set of experimental 
      replicates. Amplicon barcodes were sequenced from the blood of 56 adult zebrafish 
      divided into training and validation sets. Informative barcodes were identified and 
      samples with a high fraction of informative barcodes were chosen by bootstrapping. 
      There were 4.2 ± 1.8 barcoded HSC clones per sample in the training set and 
      3.5 ± 2.1 in the validation set (p = 0.3). SABER reproducibly quantifies functional 
      HSCs and can accommodate a wide range of experimental group sizes. Future 
      large-scale studies aiming to understand the mechanisms of HSC clonal evolution will 
      benefit from this new approach to identifying informative amplicon barcodes.

AB  - AIM: There are limited data describing incidence of symptomatic venous 
      thromboembolism (VTE) in adolescent and young adult (AYA) acute lymphoblastic 
      leukemia (ALL) patients receiving peg-asparaginase. MATERIALS & METHODS: 
      Single-institution retrospective analysis of 44 AYA ALL patients treated with 
      peg-asparaginase. Rates of VTE and proposed risk factors were assessed. RESULTS: 18 
      patients (41%) had a symptomatic VTE following peg-asparaginase. The cumulative 
      incidence rate was 25% (95% CI: 13-38%) within 30 days of the initial dose. Personal 
      history of thrombosis was statistically significantly associated with an increased 
      risk of VTE with HR of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.40-5.33, p = 0.003) after adjusting for 
      gender. CONCLUSION: These data indicate a high rate of VTE in the AYA ALL population 
      following treatment with peg-asparaginase.

AB  - In the last 10 years, oncology has been transformed by the development and broad 
      availability of small molecule therapies for cancer. Compounds have been and are 
      being developed to target nearly every known relevant component of the cell's 
      machinery. One class of compounds, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, was 
      originally conceived as an anticancer therapeutic based on the premise that as 
      cancer is (in part) defined by loss of cell-cycle control, the interruption of cell 
      cycle could arrest cancer growth. While CDKs do play critical roles in cell cycle, 
      including in cancer, the study of CDK inhibitors in the relatively non-proliferative 
      disease chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) revealed alternate mechanisms both for 
      CDKs, as well as for the role of CDK inhibitors in cancer therapy. In this review, 
      we will consider three CDK inhibitors: alvocidib (flavopiridol), dinaciclib, and 
      TG02. We will discuss their preclinical and clinical development for the treatment 
      of CLL, and suggest that CDK inhibitors remain relevant in CLL, with potential 
      utility in several scenarios.

TI  - Targeting PI3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and mTOR axis in lymphoma.
PG  - 19-32
LID - 10.1111/bjh.13065 [doi]
AB  - Targeted therapy represents a transformation in oncology, a field that has relied 
      primarily on non-selective cytotoxic therapies. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 
      is a family of ubiquitous signalling molecules involved in a wide variety of 
      cellular processes and likewise, in a broad selection of human cancers. The 
      discovery that the p110-δ form of PI3K is differentially expressed in normal and 
      malignant lymphocytes has led to the development of specific inhibitors that are 
      currently in clinical trials for lymphoma. Downstream effectors of PI3K, including 
      v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT; also termed AKT1) and 
      mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) (mTOR) are similarly 
      important in lymphoma, and agents targeting these components of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR 
      axis are also underway, although at earlier stages of development. In this review we 
      examine the role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR in normal and malignant lymphocytes, as well as 
      the preclinical and clinical status of a number of inhibitors of this pathway.

TI  - Cotargeting of XPO1 Enhances the Antileukemic Activity of Midostaurin and 
      Gilteritinib in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
LID - 10.3390/cancers12061574 [doi]
LID - 1574
AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic stem-cell-derived leukemia with 
      often successive derived driver mutations. Late onset acquisition of internal tandem 
      duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) at a high variant allele frequency often contributes 
      to full transformation to a highly proliferative, rapidly progressive disease with 
      poor outcome. The FLT3-ITD mutation is targetable with approved FLT3 small molecule 
      inhibitors, including midostaurin and gilteritinib. However, outside of patients 
      receiving allogeneic transplant, most patients fail to respond or relapse, 
      suggesting alternative approaches of therapy will be required. We employed 
      genome-wide pooled CRISPR knockout screening as a method for large-scale 
      identification of targets whose knockout produces a phenotypic effect that enhances 
      the antitumor properties of FLT3 inhibitors. Among the candidate targets we 
      identified the effect of XPO1 knockout to be synergistic with midostaurin treatment. 
      Next, we validated the genetic finding with pharmacologic combination of the slowly 
      reversible XPO1 inhibitor selinexor with midostaurin and gilteritinib in FLT3-ITD 
      AML cell lines and primary patient samples. Lastly, we demonstrated improved 
      survival with either combination therapy compared to its monotherapy components in 
      an aggressive AML murine model, supporting further evaluation and rapid clinical 
      translation of this combination strategy.

AB  - Hairy cell leukemia was initially described as a clinicopathologic entity more than 
      50 years ago. We have subsequently discovered that HCL is really at least two 
      diseases: classical HCL and the hairy cell leukemia variant. The former is among a 
      small group of cancers exceptional for being (nearly) unified by a single genetic 
      lesion, the BRAF V600E mutation. Over the past three decades, tremendous progress in 
      both diagnostic and prognostic clarification has been accompanied by therapeutic 
      advances in classical HCL. Consequently, this once uniformly fatal disease has been 
      converted in most cases into a chronic illness enabling patients to live long and 
      productive lives. In response to standard therapy, patients have high complete 
      remission rates. Unfortunately, the long-term survival curves have not plateaued, 
      revealing that this disease is controlled but not cured. Though rare and 
      representing only about 10% of an already rare disease, those patients with the 
      variant fare exceptionally poorly with standard therapy: complete response rates to 
      purine nucleoside analogs are reported to be less than 50%, whereas the complete 
      response rates in classical HCL are up to 90%. Novel small molecules targeting BRAF 
      and the B-cell receptor signaling complex, and biologic agents like antibodies and 
      immunotoxin conjugates are being explored for those patients who have relapsed. 
      Substantial opportunities for continued research remain. This complex and 
      multi-faceted disease incorporates challenges from altered immunity associated with 
      the underlying disease and its treatments. Considering the rarity of this 
      malignancy, optimization of patient management requires multi-institutional 
      collaboration. The Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation (www.hairycellleukemia.org) was 
      formed to coordinate these efforts.

AB  - Current treatment options for older and relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid 
      leukemia (AML) patients are limited and represent an unmet need. Based on 
      preclinical studies showing strong anti-leukemic effects in vivo, this phase I 
      dose-escalation study assessed the safety and preliminary clinical activity of the 
      oral exportin-1 inhibitor, selinexor, in combination with the hypomethylating agent, 
      decitabine 20 mg/m(2), in adults with R/R AML and in older (age ≥ 60) untreated AML 
      patients. There were no protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities. The recommended 
      phase 2 dose of selinexor was 60 mg (∼35 mg/m(2)) given twice-weekly. Notable grade 
      ≥3 toxicities included asymptomatic hyponatremia (68%), febrile neutropenia (44%), 
      sepsis (44%), hypophosphatemia (36%), and pneumonia (28%). In 25 patients, the 
      overall response rate was 40%. Modification of selinexor to a flat dose of 60 mg, 
      twice-weekly for two weeks after decitabine, improved tolerability of the regimen 
      and demonstrated preliminary clinical activity in poor-risk patients with AML.

TI  - Selective targeting of NAMPT by KPT-9274 in acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 242-255
LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018024182 [doi]
AB  - Treatment options for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain extremely limited and 
      associated with significant toxicity. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) 
      is involved in the generation of NAD(+) and a potential therapeutic target in AML. 
      We evaluated the effect of KPT-9274, a p21-activated kinase 4/NAMPT inhibitor that 
      possesses a unique NAMPT-binding profile based on in silico modeling compared with 
      earlier compounds pursued against this target. KPT-9274 elicited loss of 
      mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis and induced apoptosis in AML subtypes 
      independent of mutations and genomic abnormalities. These actions occurred mainly 
      through the depletion of NAD(+), whereas genetic knockdown of p21-activated kinase 4 
      did not induce cytotoxicity in AML cell lines or influence the cytotoxic effect of 
      KPT-9274. KPT-9274 exposure reduced colony formation, increased blast 
      differentiation, and diminished the frequency of leukemia-initiating cells from 
      primary AML samples; KPT-9274 was minimally cytotoxic toward normal hematopoietic or 
      immune cells. In addition, KPT-9274 improved overall survival in vivo in 2 different 
      mouse models of AML and reduced tumor development in a patient-derived xenograft 
      model of AML. Overall, KPT-9274 exhibited broad preclinical activity across a 
      variety of AML subtypes and warrants further investigation as a potential 
      therapeutic agent for AML.

PG  - 1864-1872
LID - 10.1038/s41375-021-01257-7 [doi]
AB  - Standard treatment options in classic HCL (cHCL) result in high response rates and 
      near normal life expectancy. However, the disease itself and the recommended 
      standard treatment are associated with profound and prolonged immunosuppression, 
      increasing susceptibility to infections and the risk for a severe course of 
      COVID-19. The Hairy Cell Leukemia Foundation (HCLF) has recently convened experts 
      and discussed different clinical strategies for the management of these patients. 
      The new recommendations adapt the 2017 consensus for the diagnosis and management 
      with cHCL to the current COVID-19 pandemic. They underline the option of active 
      surveillance in patients with low but stable blood counts, consider the use of 
      targeted and non-immunosuppressive agents as first-line treatment for cHCL, and give 
      recommendations on preventive measures against COVID-19.

TI  - Clinical and molecular characterization of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and

PG  - 358-368
LID - 10.1038/s41375-019-0560-3 [doi]
AB  - Sole trisomies of chromosomes 4, 8, 11, 13 and 21 account for 89-95% of all sole 
      trisomies in adult AML patients. We analyzed clinical and molecular characteristics 
      of 138 de novo AML patients with sole +4, +8, +11, +13 or +21, and compared them 
      with AML patients with those trisomies occurring in addition to other chromosome 
      abnormalities (non-sole trisomy) and with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) 
      patients. Mutations in methylation-related genes were most commonly observed within 
      each sole trisomy group (+4, 55%; +8, 58%; +11, 71%; +13, 71%; +21, 75% of 
      patients). Patients with sole trisomies, excluding +4, also had frequent mutations 
      in spliceosome genes (+8, 43%; +11, 65%; +13, 65%; +21, 45% of patients). In 
      contrast, +4 patients frequently had mutations in transcription factor genes (44%) 
      and NPM1 (36%). While 48% of patients with sole trisomies harbored mutations in a 
      spliceosome gene, spliceosome mutations were observed in only 24% of non-sole 
      trisomy (n = 131, P < 0.001) and 19% of CN-AML patients (n = 716, P < 0.001). Our 
      data suggest that mutations affecting methylation-related genes are a molecular 
      hallmark of sole trisomies. Mutations in spliceosome genes were also commonly 
      observed in many sole trisomy patients and represent a novel finding in this 
      cytogenetic subgroup.

TI  - A phase I study of lenalidomide plus chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine in 
      patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk 
      myelodysplastic syndrome.
PG  - 1457-1465
LID - 10.1002/ajh.25958 [doi]
AB  - Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have poor 
      outcomes and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative 
      treatment. New targeted therapies improved survival in select patients with specific 
      mutations, however management of patients without these molecular alterations is an 
      unmet need. We conducted a phase one study of lenalidomide in combination with 
      cytarabine/idarubicin salvage chemotherapy in patients with R/R AML and high-risk 
      myelodysplastic syndromes. A total of 33 patients were enrolled in the study (30 
      AML, 3 MDS), and treated at three dose levels with 3 + 3 design. Dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) was seen in eight patients, including four hematologic DLTs. The most 
      commonly observed non-hematologic serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia, 
      rash, sepsis and renal injury. Dose level -1, consisting of 25 mg/d lenalidomide 
      D1-21, 1 g/m(2) cytarabine D5-8, and 8 mg/m(2) idarubicin D5-7 was determined to be 
      the maximum tolerated dose. Note, 15/33 (45%) of patients were able to receive 
      pre-planned 21 days of lenalidomide. Overall, 18 patients achieved complete 
      remission (CR) (n = 14) or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) (n = 4) with 
      total CR/CRi rate of 56%. The 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS) were 24% and 
      10%, respectively. Among responders, 10/18 underwent allogeneic HCT and had a 1-year 
      OS of 40%. There was no molecular pattern associated with response. These data 
      demonstrate that the combination had clinical activity in R/R AML. This regimen 
      should be further investigated for patients who relapsed after HCT, and as a bridge 
      therapy to HCT. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01132586).

TI  - The Incidence of Invasive Fungal Infections in Patients With AML Treated With a 
      Hypomethylating Agent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who receive 
      induction with a hypomethylating agent (HMA) are often neutropenic with an increased 
      risk for invasive fungal infections (IFIs). This study analyzed the incidence and 
      risk factors for IFIs in these patients, evaluated clinical patterns in antifungal 
      prophylaxis, and assessed the diagnostic utility of tests in this setting. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: We studied 117 newly diagnosed patients with AML treated with HMAs at 
      our center, divided into groups based on concern for IFI (cIFI: all possible, 
      probable, and proven IFIs) versus no concern for IFI. The Fisher exact test compared 
      patients with cIFI versus without, and a multivariable logistic regression model 
      estimated odds for cIFI. RESULTS: Sixty-seven (57%) patients had cIFI, with 48 
      possible IFIs, 17 probable, and 2 proven cases. There was no difference in incidence 
      based on home zip code, but the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      was highly associated with cIFI (P = .001), as was male gender (P = .01). 
      Neutropenia at treatment initiation was borderline in significance (P = .08). In 
      diagnostics, 9% of patients had positive serum fungal markers, and 30 patients 
      underwent bronchoscopy, with only 27% of cases yielding positive results. There was 
      a difference in treatment regimens between patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis 
      with mold coverage versus without mold coverage with respect to cIFI (P = .04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: cIFI in patients with AML treated with HMAs remains significant, 
      especially in males and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who were 
      found to be at higher risk. This may prompt clinicians to consider anti-mold 
      prophylaxis in this setting.

TI  - Developmental subtypes assessed by DNA methylation-iPLEX forecast the natural 
      history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
PG  - 688-698
LID - 10.1182/blood.2019000490 [doi]
AB  - Alterations in global DNA methylation patterns are a major hallmark of cancer and 
      represent attractive biomarkers for personalized risk stratification. Chronic 
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) risk stratification studies typically focus on time to 
      first treatment (TTFT), time to progression (TTP) after treatment, and overall 
      survival (OS). Whereas TTFT risk stratification remains similar over time, TTP and 
      OS have changed dramatically with the introduction of targeted therapies, such as 
      the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. We have shown that genome-wide DNA 
      methylation patterns in CLL are strongly associated with phenotypic differentiation 
      and patient outcomes. Here, we developed a novel assay, termed methylation-iPLEX 
      (Me-iPLEX), for high-throughput quantification of targeted panels of single cytosine 
      guanine dinucleotides from multiple independent loci. Me-iPLEX was used to classify 
      CLL samples into 1 of 3 known epigenetic subtypes (epitypes). We examined the impact 
      of epitype in 1286 CLL patients from 4 independent cohorts representing a 
      comprehensive view of CLL disease course and therapies. We found that epitype 
      significantly predicted TTFT and OS among newly diagnosed CLL patients. 
      Additionally, epitype predicted TTP and OS with 2 common CLL therapies: 
      chemoimmunotherapy and ibrutinib. Epitype retained significance after stratifying by 
      biologically related biomarkers, immunoglobulin heavy chain mutational status, and 
      ZAP70 expression, as well as other common prognostic markers. Furthermore, among 
      several biological traits enriched between epitypes, we found highly biased 
      immunogenetic features, including IGLV3-21 usage in the poorly characterized 
      intermediate-programmed CLL epitype. In summary, Me-iPLEX is an elegant method to 
      assess epigenetic signatures, including robust classification of CLL epitypes that 
      independently stratify patient risk at diagnosis and time of treatment.

TI  - Uncovering the Genomic Landscape in Newly Diagnosed and Relapsed Pediatric 
      Cytogenetically Normal FLT3-ITD AML.
PG  - 641-647

AB  - Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations, 
      common in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), associate with early relapse and 
      poor prognosis. Past studies have suggested additional cooperative mutations are 
      required for leukemogenesis in FLT3-ITD+ AML. Using RNA sequencing and a 
      next-generation targeted gene panel, we broadly characterize the co-occurring 
      genomic alterations in pediatric cytogenetically normal (CN) FLT3-ITD+ AML to gain a 
      deeper understanding of the clonal patterns and heterogeneity at diagnosis and 
      relapse. We show that chimeric transcripts were present in 21 of 34 (62%) of de novo 
      samples, 2 (6%) of these samples included a rare reoccurring fusion partner BCL11B. 
      At diagnosis, the median number of mutations other than FLT3 per patient was 1 
      (range 0-3), which involved 8 gene pathways; WT1 and NPM1 mutations were frequently 
      observed (35% and 24%, respectively). Fusion transcripts and high variant allele 
      frequency (VAF) mutants, which included WT1, NPM1, SMARCA2, RAD21, and TYK2, were 
      retained from diagnosis to relapse. We did observe reduction in VAF of simple or 
      single mutation clones, but VAFs were preserved or expanded in more complex clones 
      with multiple mutations. Our data provide the first insight into the genomic 
      complexity of pediatric CN FLT3-ITD+ AML and could help stratify future targeted 
      treatment strategies.

      in Cytogenetically Normal Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
PG  - 6524-6531
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0725 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Uniparental disomy (UPD) is a way cancer cells duplicate a mutated gene, 
      causing loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Patients with cytogenetically normal acute 
      myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) do not have microscopically detectable chromosome 
      abnormalities, but can harbor UPDs. We examined the prognostic significance of UPDs 
      and frequency of LOH in patients with CN-AML.Experimental Design: We examined the 
      frequency and prognostic significance of UPDs in a set of 425 adult patients with de 
      novo CN-AML who were previously sequenced for 81 genes typically mutated in cancer. 
      Associations of UPDs with outcome were analyzed in the 315 patients with CN-AML 
      younger than 60 years. RESULTS: We detected 127 UPDs in 109 patients. Most UPDs were 
      large and typically encompassed all or most of the affected chromosome arm. The most 
      common UPDs occurred on chromosome arms 13q (7.5% of patients), 6p (2.8%), and 11p 
      (2.8%). Many UPDs significantly cooccurred with mutations in genes they encompassed, 
      including 13q UPD with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD; P < 0.001), and 
      11p UPD with WT1 mutations (P = 0.02). Among patients younger than 60 years, UPD of 
      11p was associated with longer overall survival (OS) and 13q UPD with shorter 
      disease-free survival (DFS) and OS. In multivariable models that accounted for known 
      prognostic markers, including FLT3-ITD and WT1 mutations, UPD of 13q maintained 
      association with shorter DFS, and UPD of 11p maintained association with longer OS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: LOH mediated by UPD is a recurrent feature of CN-AML. Detection of UPDs 
      of 13q and 11p might be useful for genetic risk stratification of patients with 
      CN-AML.

TI  - Targeting BTK through microRNA in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
PG  - 3101-3112
LID - 10.1182/blood-2016-07-727750 [doi]
AB  - Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a critical mediator of survival in B-cell 
      neoplasms. Although BTK inhibitors have transformed therapy in chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia (CLL), patients with high-risk genetics are at risk for relapse and have a 
      poor prognosis. Identification of novel therapeutic strategies for this group of 
      patients is an urgent unmet clinical need, and therapies that target BTK via 
      alternative mechanisms may fill this niche. Herein, we identify a set of microRNAs 
      (miRs) that target BTK in primary CLL cells and show that the histone deacetylase 
      (HDAC) repressor complex is recruited to these miR promoters to silence their 
      expression. Targeting the HDACs by using either RNA interference against HDAC1 in 
      CLL or a small molecule inhibitor (HDACi) in CLL and mantle cell lymphoma restored 
      the expression of the BTK-targeting miRs with loss of BTK protein and downstream 
      signaling and consequent cell death. We have also made the novel and clinically 
      relevant discovery that inhibition of HDAC induces the BTK-targeting miRs in 
      ibrutinib-sensitive and resistant CLL to effectively reduce both wild-type and 
      C481S-mutant BTK. This finding identifies a novel strategy that may be promising as 
      a therapeutic modality to eliminate the C481S-mutant BTK clone that drives 
      resistance to ibrutinib and provides the rationale for a combination strategy that 
      includes ibrutinib to dually target BTK to suppress its prosurvival signaling.

TI  - Poor Survival and Differential Impact of Genetic Features of Black Patients with 
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

AB  - Clinical outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with 
      cytogenetic and molecular factors and patient demographics (e.g., age and race). We 
      compared survival of 25,523 non-Hispanic Black and White adults with AML using 
      Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program data and performed 
      mutational profiling of 1,339 patients with AML treated on frontline Alliance for 
      Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) protocols. Black patients had shorter 
      survival than White patients, both in SEER and in the setting of Alliance clinical 
      trials. The disparity was especially pronounced in Black patients <60 years, after 
      adjustment for socioeconomic (SEER) and molecular (Alliance) factors. Black race was 
      an independent prognosticator of poor survival. Gene mutation profiles showed fewer 
      NPM1 and more IDH2 mutations in younger Black patients. Overall survival of younger 
      Black patients was adversely affected by IDH2 mutations and FLT3-ITD, but, in 
      contrast to White patients, was not improved by NPM1 mutations. SIGNIFICANCE: We 
      show that young Black patients have not benefited as much as White patients from 
      recent progress in AML treatment in the United States. Our data suggest that both 
      socioeconomic factors and differences in disease biology contribute to the survival 
      disparity and need to be urgently addressed.See related commentary by Vyas, p.

TI  - Complex karyotype in de novo acute myeloid leukemia: typical and atypical subtypes 
      differ molecularly and clinically.
PG  - 1620-1634

AB  - Complex karyotype (CK) with ≥ 3 abnormalities is detected in 10-12% of patients with 
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and associated with poor prognosis. The most common 
      unbalanced abnormalities found in CK result in loss of material from the 5q, 7q, 
      and/or 17p chromosome arms. The presence of 5q, 7q, and/or 17p abnormalities denotes 
      typical CK and their absence denotes atypical CK. Since molecular features of CK-AML 
      are not well characterized, we investigated mutational status of 81 
      leukemia/cancer-associated genes in 160 clinically well-characterized patients. They 
      included 136 patients with ≥ 3 exclusively unbalanced chromosome abnormalities, 96 
      of whom had a typical CK and 40 atypical CK, and 24 patients with ≥ 1 balanced 
      abnormality in addition to ≥ 2 unbalanced ones. Patients with atypical CK-AML 
      differed from those with typical CK-AML: they carried TP53 mutations less often 
      (P < 0.001) and more often PHF6 (P = 0.008), FLT3-TKD (P = 0.02), MED12 (P = 0.02), 
      and NPM1 (P = 0.02) mutations. They were younger (P = 0.007), had higher WBC 
      (P = 0.001) and percentages of marrow (P < 0.001) and blood (P = 0.006) blasts, 
      higher complete remission rates (P = 0.02), and longer overall survival (P < 0.001), 
      thus indicating that atypical and typical CK-AMLs constitute distinct disease 
      subtypes. We also identified smaller patient subsets within both typical and 
      atypical CK-AML that differed molecularly and clinically.

TI  - Interferon-γ Promotes Antibody-mediated Fratricide of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells.
PG  - 25656-25666
AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the proliferation of immature 
      myeloid lineage blasts. Due to its heterogeneity and to the high rate of acquired 
      drug resistance and relapse, new treatment strategies are needed. Here, we 
      demonstrate that IFNγ promotes AML blasts to act as effector cells within the 
      context of antibody therapy. Treatment with IFNγ drove AML blasts toward a more 
      differentiated state, wherein they showed increased expression of the M1-related 
      markers HLA-DR and CD86, as well as of FcγRI, which mediates effector responses to 
      therapeutic antibodies. Importantly, IFNγ was able to up-regulate CD38, the target 
      of the therapeutic antibody daratumumab. Because the antigen (CD38) and effector 
      receptor (FcγRI) were both simultaneously up-regulated on the AML blasts, we tested 
      whether IFNγ treatment of the AML cell lines THP-1 and MV4-11 could stimulate them 
      to target one another after the addition of daratumumab. Results showed that IFNγ 
      significantly increased daratumumab-mediated cytotoxicity, as measured both by 
      (51)Cr release and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. We also found that the 
      combination of IFNγ and activation of FcγR led to the release of granzyme B by AML 
      cells. Finally, using a murine NSG model of subcutaneous AML, we found that 
      treatment with IFNγ plus daratumumab significantly attenuated tumor growth. Taken 
      together, these studies show a novel mechanism of daratumumab-mediated killing and a 
      possible new therapeutic strategy for AML.

TI  - EGR2 mutations define a new clinically aggressive subgroup of chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia.
PG  - 1547-1554
LID - 10.1038/leu.2016.359 [doi]
AB  - Recurrent mutations within EGR2 were recently reported in advanced-stage chronic 
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and associated with a worse outcome. To study 
      their prognostic impact, 2403 CLL patients were examined for mutations in the EGR2 
      hotspot region including a screening (n=1283) and two validation cohorts (UK CLL4 
      trial patients, n=366; CLL Research Consortium (CRC) patients, n=490). Targeted 
      deep-sequencing of 27 known/postulated CLL driver genes was also performed in 38 
      EGR2-mutated patients to assess concurrent mutations. EGR2 mutations were detected 
      in 91/2403 (3.8%) investigated cases, and associated with younger age at diagnosis, 
      advanced clinical stage, high CD38 expression and unmutated IGHV genes. EGR2-mutated 
      patients frequently carried ATM lesions (42%), TP53 aberrations (18%) and 
      NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations (16%). EGR2 mutations independently predicted shorter 
      time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) in the screening cohort; 
      they were confirmed associated with reduced TTFT and OS in the CRC cohort and 
      independently predicted short OS from randomization in the UK CLL4 cohort. A 
      particularly dismal outcome was observed among EGR2-mutated patients who also 
      carried TP53 aberrations. In summary, EGR2 mutations were independently associated 
      with an unfavorable prognosis, comparable to CLL patients carrying TP53 aberrations, 
      suggesting that EGR2-mutated patients represent a new patient subgroup with very 
      poor outcome.

AB  - Targeted mutation assessment of 81 genes in 1021 adults with de novo acute myeloid 
      leukemia (AML) identified recurrent mutations in the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene in 
      52 (5.1%) patients, including 36 (5.2%) younger and 16 (4.8%) older patients, which 
      suggests NF1 belongs to the 20 most frequently mutated genes in adult AML. NF1 
      mutations were found throughout the gene, and comprised missense, frameshift, and 
      nonsense mutations. One mutation hotspot, at amino acid threonine 676 (Thr676), was 
      found in 27% of AML patients with NF1 mutations. NF1-mutated patients belonged more 
      often to the adverse European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk category than NF1 wild-type 
      patients. Among patients aged <60 years, the presence of NF1 Thr676 mutations was 
      associated with lower complete remission (CR) rates (P = 0.04) and shorter overall 
      survival (OS; P = 0.01), as was the presence of any NF1 mutation in patients in the 
      adverse ELN risk category (CR, P = 0.05; OS, P < 0.001). CR rates were also lower in 
      NF1-mutated patients aged ≥60 years compared with NF1 wild-type patients 
      (P = 0.001). In summary, our findings provide novel insights into the frequency of 
      NF1 mutations in AML, and are suggestive of an adverse prognostic impact in patients 
      treated with standard chemotherapy.

TI  - Near-tetraploidy is associated with Richter transformation in chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia patients receiving ibrutinib.
PG  - 1584-1588
LID - 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007302 [doi]
AB  - Ibrutinib is a highly effective targeted therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
      (CLL). However, ibrutinib must be discontinued in a subset of patients due to 
      progressive CLL or transformation to aggressive lymphoma (Richter transformation). 
      Transformation occurs early in the course of therapy and has an extremely poor 
      prognosis. Thus, identification of prognostic markers associated with transformation 
      is of utmost importance. Near-tetraploidy (4 copies of most chromosomes within a 
      cell) has been reported in various lymphomas, but its incidence and significance in 
      CLL has not been described. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we detected 
      near-tetraploidy in 9 of 297 patients with CLL prior to beginning ibrutinib 
      treatment on 1 of 4 clinical trials (3.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4%-5.7%). 
      Near-tetraploidy was associated with aggressive disease characteristics: Rai stage 
      3/4 (P = .03), deletion 17p (P = .03), and complex karyotype (P = .01). 
      Near-tetraploidy was also associated with ibrutinib discontinuation due to Richter 
      transformation (P < .0001), but not due to progressive CLL (P = .41). Of the 9 
      patients with near-tetraploidy, 6 had Richter transformation with diffuse large 
      B-cell lymphoma. In a multivariable model, near-tetraploidy (hazard ratio [HR], 
      8.66; 95% CI, 3.83-19.59; P < .0001) and complex karyotype (HR, 4.77; 95% CI, 
      1.42-15.94; P = .01) were independent risk factors for discontinuing ibrutinib due 
      to transformation. Our results suggest that near-tetraploidy is a potential 
      prognostic marker for Richter transformation to assess in patients going on 
      ibrutinib.

TI  - Phase 2 study of ibrutinib in classic and variant hairy cell leukemia.
PG  - 3473-3483
LID - 10.1182/blood.2020009688 [doi]
AB  - Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare B-cell malignancy, and there is a need for novel 
      treatments for patients who do not benefit from purine analogs. Ibrutinib, an oral 
      agent targeting Bruton tyrosine kinase in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, is 
      highly effective in several malignancies. Its activity in HCL was unknown, so we 
      conducted a multisite phase 2 study of oral ibrutinib in patients with either 
      relapsed classic or variant hairy cell leukemia. The primary outcome measure was the 
      overall response rate (ORR) at 32 weeks, and we also assessed response at 48 weeks 
      and best response during treatment. Key secondary objectives were characterization 
      of toxicity and determination of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
      survival (OS). Thirty-seven patients were enrolled at 2 different doses (24 at 420 
      mg, 13 at 840 mg). The median duration of follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 0-5.9 
      years). The ORR at 32 weeks was 24%, which increased to 36% at 48 weeks. The best 
      ORR was 54%. The estimated 36-month PFS was 73% and OS was 85%. The most frequent 
      adverse events were diarrhea (59%), fatigue (54%), myalgia (54%), and nausea (51%). 
      Hematologic adverse events were common: anemia (43%), thrombocytopenia (41%), and 
      neutropenia (35%). Ibrutinib can be safely administered to patients with HCL with 
      objective responses and results in prolonged disease control. Although the initial 
      primary outcome objective of the study was not met, the observation of objective 
      responses in heavily pretreated patients coupled with a favorable PFS suggests that 
      ibrutinib may be beneficial in these patients. This trial was registered at 
      www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01841723.

LID - 10.1038/s41375-021-01295-1 [doi]
AB  - Hematopoiesis is hierarchical, and it has been postulated that acute myeloid 
      leukemia (AML) is organized similarly with leukemia stem cells (LSCs) residing at 
      the apex. Limited cells acquired by fluorescence activated cell sorting in tandem 
      with targeted amplicon-based sequencing (LC-FACSeq) enables identification of 
      mutations in small subpopulations of cells, such as LSCs. Leveraging this, we 
      studied clonal compositions of immunophenotypically-defined compartments in AML 
      through genomic and functional analyses at diagnosis, remission and relapse in 88 
      AML patients. Mutations involving DNA methylation pathways, transcription factors 
      and spliceosomal machinery did not differ across compartments, while signaling 
      pathway mutations were less frequent in putative LSCs. We also provide insights into 
      TP53-mutated AML by demonstrating stepwise acquisition of mutations beginning from 
      the preleukemic hematopoietic stem cell stage. In 10 analyzed cases, acquisition of 
      additional mutations and del(17p) led to genetic and functional heterogeneity within 
      the LSC pool with subclones harboring varying degrees of clonogenic potential. 
      Finally, we use LC-FACSeq to track clonal evolution in serial samples, which can 
      also be a powerful tool to direct targeted therapy against measurable residual 
      disease. Therefore, studying clinically significant small subpopulations of cells 
      can improve our understanding of AML biology and offers advantages over bulk 
      sequencing to monitor the evolution of disease.

      data.
PG  - 3567-74
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu583 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: DNA methylation is an epigenetic change occurring in genomic CpG 
      sequences that contribute to the regulation of gene transcription both in normal and 
      malignant cells. Next-generation sequencing has been used to characterize DNA 
      methylation status at the genome scale, but suffers from high sequencing cost in the 
      case of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, or from reduced resolution (inability to 
      precisely define which of the CpGs are methylated) with capture-based techniques. 
      RESULTS: Here we present a computational method that computes nucleotide-resolution 
      methylation values from capture-based data by incorporating fragment length profiles 
      into a model of methylation analysis. We demonstrate that it compares favorably with 
      nucleotide-resolution bisulfite sequencing and has better predictive power with 
      respect to a reference than window-based methods, often used for enrichment data. 
      The described method was used to produce the methylation data used in tandem with 
      gene expression to produce a novel and clinically significant gene signature in 
      acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, we introduce a complementary statistical method 
      that uses this nucleotide-resolution methylation data for detection of 
      differentially methylated features.

PG  - 7-14
LID - 10.4137/CIN.S14022 [doi]
AB  - QuaCRS (Quality Control for RNA-Seq) is an integrated, simplified quality control 
      (QC) system for RNA-seq data that allows easy execution of several open-source QC 
      tools, aggregation of their output, and the ability to quickly identify quality 
      issues by performing meta-analyses on QC metrics across large numbers of samples in 
      different studies. It comprises two main sections. First is the QC Pack wrapper, 
      which executes three QC tools: FastQC, RNA-SeQC, and selected functions from RSeQC. 
      Combining these three tools into one wrapper provides increased ease of use and 
      provides a much more complete view of sample data quality than any individual tool. 
      Second is the QC database, which displays the resulting metrics in a user-friendly 
      web interface. It was designed to allow users with less computational experience to 
      easily generate and view QC information for their data, to investigate individual 
      samples and aggregate reports of sample groups, and to sort and search samples based 
      on quality. The structure of the QuaCRS database is designed to enable expansion 
      with additional tools and metrics in the future. The source code for not-for-profit 
      use and a fully functional sample user interface with mock data are available at 
      http://bioserv.mps.ohio-state.edu/QuaCRS/.

TI  - A precision medicine classification for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in older

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older patients (≥ 60 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) often have 
      multiple, sequentially acquired, somatic mutations that drive leukemogenesis and are 
      associated with poor outcome. Beat AML is a Leukemia and Lymphoma Society-sponsored, 
      multicenter umbrella study that algorithmically segregates AML patients based upon 
      cytogenetic and dominant molecular abnormalities (variant allele frequencies 
      (VAF) ≥ 0.2) into different cohorts to select for targeted therapies. During the 
      conception of the Beat AML design, a historical dataset was needed to help in the 
      design of the genomic algorithm for patient assignment and serve as the basis for 
      the statistical design of individual genomic treatment substudies for the Beat AML 
      study. METHODS: We classified 563 newly diagnosed older AML patients treated with 
      standard intensive chemotherapy on trials conducted by Cancer and Leukemia Group B 
      based on the same genomic algorithm and assessed clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Our 
      classification identified core-binding factor and NPM1-mutated/FLT3-ITD-negative 
      groups as having the best outcomes, with 30-day early death (ED) rates of 0 and 20%, 
      respectively, and median overall survival (OS) of > 1 year and 3-year OS rates 
      of ≥ 20%. All other genomic groups had ED rates of 17-42%, median OS ≤ 1 year and 
      3-year OS rates of ≤ 15%. CONCLUSIONS: By classifying patients through this genomic 
      algorithm, outcomes were poor and not unexpected from a non-algorithmic, 
      non-dominant VAF approach. The exception is 30-day ED rate typically is not 
      available for intensive induction for individual genomic groups and therefore 
      difficult to compare outcomes with targeted therapeutics. This Alliance data 
      supported the use of this algorithm for patient assignment at the initiation of the 
      Beat AML study. This outcome data was also used for statistical design for Beat AML 
      substudies for individual genomic groups to determine goals for improvement from 
      intensive induction and hopefully lead to more rapid approval of new therapies.

TI  - Expression and prognostic impact of lncRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 18679-84
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1422050112 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, located 
      within the intergenic stretches or overlapping antisense transcripts of protein 
      coding genes. LncRNAs are involved in numerous biological roles including 
      imprinting, epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. To determine whether 
      lncRNAs are associated with clinical features and recurrent mutations in older 
      patients (aged ≥60 y) with cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 
      we evaluated lncRNA expression in 148 untreated older CN-AML cases using a custom 
      microarray platform. An independent set of 71 untreated older patients with CN-AML 
      was used to validate the outcome scores using RNA sequencing. Distinctive lncRNA 
      profiles were found associated with selected mutations, such as internal tandem 
      duplications in the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) and mutations in the NPM1, CEBPA, IDH2, 
      ASXL1, and RUNX1 genes. Using the lncRNAs most associated with event-free survival 
      in a training cohort of 148 older patients with CN-AML, we derived a lncRNA score 
      composed of 48 lncRNAs. Patients with an unfavorable compared with favorable lncRNA 
      score had a lower complete response (CR) rate [P < 0.001, odds ratio = 0.14, 54% vs. 
      89%], shorter disease-free survival (DFS) [P < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.88] and 
      overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001, HR = 2.95). The validation set analyses confirmed 
      these results (CR, P = 0.03; DFS, P = 0.009; OS, P = 0.009). Multivariable analyses 
      for CR, DFS, and OS identified the lncRNA score as an independent marker for 
      outcome. In conclusion, lncRNA expression in AML is closely associated with 
      recurrent mutations. A small subset of lncRNAs is correlated strongly with treatment 
      response and survival.

TI  - Identification of NRAS isoform 2 overexpression as a mechanism facilitating BRAF 
      inhibitor resistance in malignant melanoma.
PG  - 9629-9634
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1704371114 [doi]
AB  - Activating mutations in BRAF are found in 50% of melanomas and although treatment 
      with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) is effective, resistance often develops. We now show 
      that recently discovered NRAS isoform 2 is up-regulated in the setting of BRAF 
      inhibitor resistance in melanoma, in both cell lines and patient tumor tissues. When 
      isoform 2 was overexpressed in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines, melanoma cell 
      proliferation and in vivo tumor growth were significantly increased in the presence 
      of BRAFi treatment. shRNA-mediated knockdown of isoform 2 in BRAFi resistant cells 
      restored sensitivity to BRAFi compared with controls. Signaling analysis indicated 
      decreased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling and increased 
      phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway signaling in isoform 2 overexpressing cells 
      compared with isoform 1 overexpressing cells. Immunoprecipitation of isoform 2 
      validated a binding affinity of this isoform to both PI3K and BRAF/RAF1. The 
      addition of an AKT inhibitor to BRAFi treatment resulted in a partial restoration of 
      BRAFi sensitivity in cells expressing high levels of isoform 2. NRAS isoform 2 may 
      contribute to resistance to BRAFi by facilitating PI3K pathway activation.

TI  - The mutational oncoprint of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities in adult patients 
      with de novo acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 2211-2218
LID - 10.1038/leu.2017.86 [doi]
AB  - Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations detected at the time of 
      diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are associated with particular disease 
      features, treatment response and survival of AML patients, and are used to denote 
      specific disease entities in the World Health Organization classification of myeloid 
      neoplasms and acute leukemia. However, large studies that integrate cytogenetic and 
      comprehensive mutational information are scarce. We created a comprehensive 
      oncoprint of mutations associated with recurrent cytogenetic findings by combining 
      the information on mutational patterns of 80 cancer- and leukemia-associated genes 
      with cytogenetic findings in 1603 adult patients with de novo AML. We show unique 
      differences in the mutational profiles among major cytogenetic subsets, identify 
      novel associations between recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities and both specific 
      gene mutations and gene functional groups, and reveal differences in cytogenetic and 
      mutational features between patients younger than 60 years and those aged 60 years 
      or older. The identified associations between cytogenetic and molecular genetic data 
      may help guide mutation testing in AML, and result in more focused application of 
      targeted therapy in patients with de novo AML.

      acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 747-761

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a molecularly complex disease characterized by 
      heterogeneous tumor genetic profiles and involving numerous pathogenic mechanisms 
      and pathways. Integration of molecular data types across multiple patient cohorts 
      may advance current genetic approaches for improved subclassification and 
      understanding of the biology of the disease. Here, we analyzed genome-wide DNA 
      methylation in 649 AML patients using Illumina arrays and identified a configuration 
      of 13 subtypes (termed "epitypes") using unbiased clustering. Integration of genetic 
      data revealed that most epitypes were associated with a certain recurrent mutation 
      (or combination) in a majority of patients, yet other epitypes were largely 
      independent. Epitypes showed developmental blockage at discrete stages of myeloid 
      differentiation, revealing epitypes that retain arrested hematopoietic 
      stem-cell-like phenotypes. Detailed analyses of DNA methylation patterns identified 
      unique patterns of aberrant hyper- and hypomethylation among epitypes, with variable 
      involvement of transcription factors influencing promoter, enhancer, and repressed 
      regions. Patients in epitypes with stem-cell-like methylation features showed 
      inferior overall survival along with up-regulated stem cell gene expression 
      signatures. We further identified a DNA methylation signature involving STAT motifs 
      associated with FLT3-ITD mutations. Finally, DNA methylation signatures were stable 
      at relapse for the large majority of patients, and rare epitype switching 
      accompanied loss of the dominant epitype mutations and reversion to stem-cell-like 
      methylation patterns. These results show that DNA methylation-based classification 
      integrates important molecular features of AML to reveal the diverse pathogenic and 
      biological aspects of the disease.

TI  - MonoSeq Variant Caller Reveals Novel Mononucleotide Run Indel Mutations in Tumors 
      with Defective DNA Mismatch Repair.
PG  - 1004-12
LID - 10.1002/humu.23036 [doi]
AB  - Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized cancer genetics, but accurately 
      detecting mutations in repetitive DNA sequences, especially mononucleotide runs, 
      remains a challenge. This is a particular concern for tumors with defective mismatch 
      repair (MMR) that accumulate strand-slippage mutations. We developed MonoSeq to 
      improve indel mutation detection in mononucleotide runs, and used MonoSeq to 
      investigate strand-slippage mutations in endometrial cancers, a tumor type that has 
      frequent loss of MMR. We performed extensive Sanger sequencing to validate both 
      clonal and subclonal MonoSeq mutation calls. Eighty-one regions containing 
      mononucleotide runs were sequenced in 540 primary endometrial cancers (223 with 
      defective MMR). Our analyses revealed that the overall mutation rate in 
      MMR-deficient tumors was 20-30-fold higher than in MMR-normal tumors. MonoSeq 
      analysis identified several previously unreported mutations, including a novel 
      hotspot in an A7 run in the terminal exon of ARID5B.The ARID5B indel mutations were 
      seen in both MMR-deficient and MMR-normal tumors, suggesting biologic selection. The 
      analysis of tumor mRNAs revealed the presence of mutant transcripts that could 
      result in translation of neopeptides. Improved detection of mononucleotide run 
      strand-slippage mutations has clear implications for comprehensive mutation 
      detection in tumors with defective MMR. Indel frameshift mutations and the resultant 
      antigenic peptides could help guide immunotherapy strategies.

TI  - Mutations in the CCND1 and CCND2 genes are frequent events in adult patients with 
      t(8;21)(q22;q22) acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 1278-1285
LID - 10.1038/leu.2016.332 [doi]
AB  - Core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (CBF-AML) is defined by the presence of 
      either t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or 
      inv(16)(p13.1q22)/t(16;16)(p13.1;q22)/CBFB-MYH11. The resulting fusion genes require 
      a 'second hit' to initiate leukemogenesis. Mutation assessment of 177 adults with 
      CBF-AML, including 68 with t(8;21) and 109 with inv(16)/t(16;16), identified not 
      only mutations well known in CBF-AML but also mutations in the CCND1 and CCND2 
      genes, which represent novel frequent molecular alterations in AML with t(8;21). 
      Altogether, CCND1 (n=2) and CCND2 (n=8) mutations were detected in 10 (15%) patients 
      with t(8;21) in our cohort. A single CCND2 mutation was also found in 1 (0.9%) 
      patient with inv(16). In contrast, CCND1 and CCND2 mutations were detected in only 
      11 (0.77%) of 1426 non-CBF-AML patients. All CCND2 mutations cluster around the 
      highly conserved amino-acid residue threonine 280 (Thr280). We show that 
      Thr280Ala-mutated CCND2 leads to increased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma 
      protein, thereby causing significant cell cycle changes and increased proliferation 
      of AML cell lines. The identification of CCND1 and CCND2 mutations as frequent 
      mutational events in t(8;21) AML may provide further justification for cell 
      cycle-directed therapy in this disease.

TI  - PKC-β as a therapeutic target in CLL: PKC inhibitor AEB071 demonstrates preclinical 
      activity in CLL.
PG  - 1481-91
LID - 10.1182/blood-2014-05-574830 [doi]
AB  - Targeting B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has 
      been successful with durable remissions observed with several targeted therapeutics. 
      Protein kinase C-β (PKC-β) is immediately downstream of BCR and has been shown to be 
      essential to CLL cell survival and proliferation in vivo. We therefore evaluated 
      sotrastaurin (AEB071), an orally administered potent PKC inhibitor, on CLL cell 
      survival both in vitro and in vivo. AEB071 shows selective cytotoxicity against 
      B-CLL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, AEB071 attenuates BCR-mediated 
      survival pathways, inhibits CpG-induced survival and proliferation of CLL cells in 
      vitro, and effectively blocks microenvironment-mediated survival signaling pathways 
      in primary CLL cells. Furthermore, AEB071 alters β-catenin expression, resulting in 
      decreased downstream transcriptional genes as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and CD44. Lastly, 
      our preliminary in vivo studies indicate beneficial antitumor properties of AEB071 
      in CLL. Taken together, our results indicate that targeting PKC-β has the potential 
      to disrupt signaling from the microenvironment contributing to CLL cell survival and 
      potentially drug resistance. Future efforts targeting PKC with the PKC inhibitor 
      AEB071 as monotherapy in clinical trials of relapsed and refractory CLL patients are 
      warranted.

TI  - Mutational Landscape and Gene Expression Patterns in Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemias 
      with Monosomy 7 as a Sole Abnormality.
PG  - 207-218
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-16-1386 [doi]
AB  - Monosomy of chromosome 7 is the most frequent autosomal monosomy in acute myeloid 
      leukemia (AML), where it associates with poor clinical outcomes. However, molecular 
      features associated with this sole monosomy subtype (-7 AML), which may give 
      insights into the basis for its poor prognosis, have not been characterized. In this 
      study, we analyzed 36 cases of -7 AML for mutations in 81 leukemia/cancer-associated 
      genes using a customized targeted next-generation sequencing panel (Miseq). Global 
      gene and miRNA expression profiles were also determined using paired RNA and small 
      RNA sequencing data. Notably, gene mutations were detected in all the major 
      AML-associated functional groups, which include activated signaling, chromatin 
      remodeling, cohesin complex, methylation, NPM1, spliceosome, transcription factors, 
      and tumor suppressors. Gene mutations in the chromatin remodeling groups were 
      relatively more frequent in patients <60 years of age, who also had less mutations 
      in the methylation and spliceosome groups compared with patients ≥60 years of age. 
      Novel recurrent mutational events in AML were identified in the SMARCA2 gene. In 
      patients ≥60 years of age, the presence of spliceosome mutations associated with a 
      lower complete remission rate (P = 0.03). RNA sequencing revealed distinct gene and 
      miRNA expression patterns between the sole -7 and non -7 AML cases, with reduced 
      expression, as expected, of many genes and miRNAs mapped to chromosome 7, and 
      overexpression of ID1, MECOM, and PTPRM, among others. Overall, our findings 
      illuminate a number of molecular features of the underlying aggressive pathobiology 
      in -7 AML patients. Cancer Res; 77(1); 207-18. ©2016 AACR.

TI  - Immunoglobulin transcript sequence and somatic hypermutation computation from 
      unselected RNA-seq reads in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
PG  - 4322-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1503587112 [doi]
AB  - Immunoglobulins (Ig) are produced by B lymphocytes as secreted antibodies or as part 
      of the B-cell receptor. There is tremendous diversity of potential Ig transcripts 
      (>1 × 10(12)) as a result of hundreds of germ-line gene segments, random nucleotide 
      incorporation during joining of gene segments into a complete transcript, and the 
      process of somatic hypermutation at individual nucleotides. This recombination and 
      mutation process takes place in the maturing B cell and is responsible for the 
      diversity of potential epitope recognition. Cancers arising from mature B cells are 
      characterized by clonal production of Ig heavy (IGH@) and light chain transcripts, 
      although whether the sequence has undergone somatic hypermutation is dependent on 
      the maturation stage at which the neoplastic clone arose. Chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults and arises from a mature B cell 
      with either mutated or unmutated IGH@ transcripts, the latter having worse prognosis 
      and the assessment of which is routinely performed in the clinic. Currently, IGHV 
      mutation status is assessed by Sanger sequencing and comparing the transcript to 
      known germ-line genes. In this paper, we demonstrate that complete IGH@ V-D-J 
      sequences can be computed from unselected RNA-seq reads with results equal or 
      superior to the clinical procedure: in the only discordant case, the clinical 
      transcript was out-of-frame. Therefore, a single RNA-seq assay can simultaneously 
      yield gene expression profile, SNP and mutation information, as well as IGHV 
      mutation status, and may one day be performed as a general test to capture 
      multidimensional clinically relevant data in CLL.

TI  - Insertion of atypical glycans into the tumor antigen-binding site identifies DLBCLs 
      with distinct origin and behavior.
LID - blood.2021012052 [pii]
LID - 10.1182/blood.2021012052 [doi]
AB  - Glycosylation of the surface immunoglobulin variable region is a remarkable 
      follicular lymphoma-associated feature rarely seen in normal B cells. Here, we 
      define a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) which acquire 
      N-glycosylation sites selectively in the immunoglobulin (Ig) 
      complementary-determining-regions (CDR) of the antigen-binding sites. 
      Mass-spectrometry and X-ray crystallography demonstrate how the inserted glycans are 
      stalled at oligomannose-type structures due to burial in the CDR loops. Acquisition 
      of sites occurs in ~50% of germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL, mainly of the genetic 
      EZB subtype, irrespective of IGHV-D-J use. This markedly contrasts with the 
      activated B-cell-like DLBCL Ig, which rarely has sites in the CDR, and appears not 
      to acquire oligomannose-type structures. Acquisition of CDR-located acceptor sites 
      associates with mutations of epigenetic regulators and BCL2 translocations, 
      indicating an origin shared with follicular lymphoma. Within the EZB subtype, these 
      sites associate with more rapid disease progression and with significant gene-set 
      enrichment of the B-cell receptor, PI3K/AKT/MTORC1, glucose metabolism, and MYC 
      signaling pathways, particularly in the fraction devoid of MYC translocations. The 
      oligomannose-type glycans on the lymphoma cells interact with the candidate lectin 
      DC-SIGN, mediating low-level signals, and lectin-expressing cells form clusters with 
      lymphoma cells. Both clustering and signaling are inhibited by antibodies 
      specifically targeting the DC-SIGN carbohydrate-recognition-domain. 
      Oligomannosylation of the tumor immunoglobulin is a post-translational modification 
      that readily identifies a distinct GCB-DLBCL category with more aggressive clinical 
      behavior, and could be a potential precise therapeutic target via antibody-mediated 
      inhibition of the tumor Ig interaction with DC-SIGN-expressing M2-polarized 
      macrophages.

TI  - BRD4 Profiling Identifies Critical Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Oncogenic Circuits 
      and Reveals Sensitivity to PLX51107, a Novel Structurally Distinct BET Inhibitor.
PG  - 458-477
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-17-0902 [doi]
AB  - Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins are key regulators of gene 
      expression in cancer. Herein, we utilize BRD4 profiling to identify critical 
      pathways involved in pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). BRD4 is 
      overexpressed in CLL and is enriched proximal to genes upregulated or de novo 
      expressed in CLL with known functions in disease pathogenesis and progression. These 
      genes, including key members of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, provide 
      a rationale for this therapeutic approach to identify new targets in alternative 
      types of cancer. Additionally, we describe PLX51107, a structurally distinct BET 
      inhibitor with novel in vitro and in vivo pharmacologic properties that emulates or 
      exceeds the efficacy of BCR signaling agents in preclinical models of CLL. Herein, 
      the discovery of the involvement of BRD4 in the core CLL transcriptional program 
      provides a compelling rationale for clinical investigation of PLX51107 as epigenetic 
      therapy in CLL and application of BRD4 profiling in other cancers.Significance: To 
      date, functional studies of BRD4 in CLL are lacking. Through integrated genomic, 
      functional, and pharmacologic analyses, we uncover the existence of BRD4-regulated 
      core CLL transcriptional programs and present preclinical proof-of-concept studies 
      validating BET inhibition as an epigenetic approach to target BCR signaling in CLL.

PG  - 182-91
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2014.93 [doi]
AB  - Prospective studies on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in African 
      Americans with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not previously been 
      performed. In this phase II randomized study, 55 African Americans with NSCLC 
      received 150 mg/day erlotinib or a body weight-adjusted dose with subsequent 
      escalations to the maximum-allowable dose, 200 mg/day, to achieve rash. Erlotinib 
      and OSI-420 exposures were lower than those observed in previous studies, consistent 
      with CYP3A pharmacogenetics implying higher metabolic activity. Tumor genetics 
      showed only two EGFR mutations, EGFR amplification in 17/47 samples, eight KRAS 
      mutations, and five EML4-ALK translocations. Although absence of rash was associated 
      with shorter time to progression (TTP), disease-control rate, TTP, and 1-year 
      survival were not different between the two dose groups, indicating the dose-to-rash 
      strategy failed to increase clinical benefit. Low incidence of toxicity and low 
      erlotinib exposure suggest standardized and maximum-allowable dosing may be 
      suboptimal in African Americans.

AB  - Thus far, only 5-15% of AML patients aged ≥60 years are cured with chemotherapy. 
      Identification of patients who are less (more) likely to respond to standard

      regimens. We used a next-generation sequencing panel of 80 cancer- and/or 
      leukemia-associated genes to profile molecularly 423 older patients with de novo 
      AML. Using variables identified in multivariable models and co-occurring mutations 
      in NPM1-mutated AML, we classified the patients into good-, intermediate-, and 
      poor-risk groups for complete remission (CR) attainment, disease-free (DFS), and 
      overall survival (OS). Whereas 81% of good-risk patients (comprising NPM1-mutated 
      patients harboring mutations in chromatin remodeling, cohesin complex, 
      methylation-related, spliceosome, and/or RAS pathway genes, FLT3-TKD, and/or 
      patients without FLT3-ITD) achieved a CR, only 32% of poor-risk patients (with 
      U2AF1, WT1 mutations and/or complex karyotype) did. Intermediate-risk patients had a 
      50% CR rate. Similarly, using NPM1 co-mutation patterns and SF1 mutation status, we 
      identified patients with favorable DFS and OS 3-year rates of 46% and 45%, 
      respectively. Patients with adverse genetic features had DFS and OS rates of only 2% 
      and 4%. We show that application of our proposed criteria may refine the 2017 
      European LeukemiaNet classification for older patients treated with chemotherapy.

TI  - The long noncoding RNA, treRNA, decreases DNA damage and is associated with poor 
      response to chemotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
PG  - 25942-25954
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.15401 [doi]
AB  - The study of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is an emerging area of cancer research, 
      in part due to their ability to serve as disease biomarkers. However, few studies 
      have investigated lncRNAs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have identified 
      one particular lncRNA, treRNA, which is overexpressed in CLL B-cells. We measured 
      transcript expression in 144 CLL patient samples and separated samples into high or 
      low expression of treRNA relative to the overall median. We found that high 
      expression of treRNA is significantly associated with shorter time to treatment. 
      High treRNA also correlates with poor prognostic indicators such as unmutated IGHV 
      and high ZAP70 protein expression. We validated these initial findings in samples 
      collected in a clinical trial comparing the nucleoside analog fludarabine alone or 
      in combination with the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide in untreated CLL samples 
      collected prior to starting therapy (E2997). High expression of treRNA was 
      independently prognostic for shorter progression free survival in patients receiving 
      fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. Given these results, in order to study the role 
      of treRNA in DNA damage response we generated a model cell line system where treRNA 
      was over-expressed in the human B-CLL cell line OSU-CLL. Relative to the vector 
      control line, there was less cell death in OSU-CLL over-expressing treRNA after 
      exposure to fludarabine and mafosfamide, due in part to a reduction in DNA damage. 
      Therefore, we suggest that treRNA is a novel biomarker in CLL associated with 
      aggressive disease and poor response to chemotherapy through enhanced protection 
      against cytotoxic mediated DNA damage.

TI  - Cotreatment of hairy cell leukemia and melanoma with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib.
PG  - 9-13; quiz 13
AB  - The activating BRAF mutation p.V600E has been identified in many cancers, including 
      colon and lung adenocarcinomas, papillary thyroid cancer, malignant melanoma, and 
      hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Malignant melanoma and HCL are of particular interest 
      because of both the high proportion of cases harboring the mutation and the dramatic 
      responses to BRAF inhibitor therapy reported in the literature. This report presents 
      a patient with HCL and malignant melanoma with the BRAF p.V600E mutation, and 
      discusses the successful treatment of both cancers with the BRAF inhibitor 
      dabrafenib.

TI  - Targeting DNA Damage Repair Functions of Two Histone Deacetylases, HDAC8 and SIRT6, 
      Sensitizes Acute Myeloid Leukemia to NAMPT Inhibition.
PG  - 2352-2366
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-3724 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors (NAMPTi) are 
      currently in development, but may be limited as single-agent therapy due to 
      compound-specific toxicity and cancer metabolic plasticity allowing resistance 
      development. To potentially lower the doses of NAMPTis required for therapeutic 
      benefit against acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we performed a genome-wide CRISPRi 
      screen to identify rational disease-specific partners for a novel NAMPTi, KPT-9274. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cell lines and primary cells were analyzed for cell viability, 
      self-renewal, and responses at RNA and protein levels with loss-of-function 
      approaches and pharmacologic treatments. In vivo efficacy of combination therapy was 
      evaluated with a xenograft model. RESULTS: We identified two histone deacetylases 
      (HDAC), HDAC8 and SIRT6, whose knockout conferred synthetic lethality with KPT-9274 
      in AML. Furthermore, HDAC8-specific inhibitor, PCI-34051, or clinical class I HDAC 
      inhibitor, AR-42, in combination with KPT-9274, synergistically decreased the 
      survival of AML cells in a dose-dependent manner. AR-42/KPT-9274 cotreatment 
      attenuated colony-forming potentials of patient cells while sparing healthy 
      hematopoietic cells. Importantly, combined therapy demonstrated promising in vivo 
      efficacy compared with KPT-9274 or AR-42 monotherapy. Mechanistically, genetic 
      inhibition of SIRT6 potentiated the effect of KPT-9274 on PARP-1 suppression by 
      abolishing mono-ADP ribosylation. AR-42/KPT-9274 cotreatment resulted in synergistic 
      attenuation of homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining pathways in 
      cell lines and leukemia-initiating cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence 
      that HDAC8 inhibition- or shSIRT6-induced DNA repair deficiencies are potently 
      synergistic with NAMPT targeting, with minimal toxicity toward normal cells, 
      providing a rationale for a novel-novel combination-based treatment for AML.

TI  - Persistence of DNMT3A R882 mutations during remission does not adversely affect 
      outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.
PG  - 226-236
LID - 10.1111/bjh.14254 [doi]
AB  - Somatic mutation of the DNMT3A gene at the arginine R882 site is common in acute 
      myeloid leukaemia (AML). The prognostic significance of DNMT3A R882 mutation 
      clearance, using traditional diagnostic next generation sequencing (NGS) methods, 
      during complete remission (CR) in AML patients is controversial. We examined the 
      impact of clearing DNMT3A R882 mutations at diagnosis to the detectable threshold of 
      ˂3% during CR on outcome in 56 adult AML patients. Mutational remission, defined as 
      clearance of pre-treatment DNMT3A R882 and all other AML-associated mutations to a 
      variant allele frequency ˂3%, occurred in 14 patients whereas persistent DNMT3A R882 
      mutations were observed in 42 patients. There were no significant differences in 
      disease-free or overall survival between patients with and without DNMT3A R882 
      mutation clearance. Patients with persistent DNMT3A R882 who cleared all other AML 
      mutations and did not acquire new mutations (n = 30), trended towards longer 
      disease-free survival (1·6 vs. 0·6 years, P = 0·06) than patients with persistence 
      of DNMT3A R882, in addition to other mutations or acquisition of new AML-associated 
      mutations, such as those in TET2, JAK2, ASXL1 and TP53 (n = 12). These data 
      demonstrate that DNMT3A R882 mutations, as assessed by traditional NGS methods, 
      persist in the majority of AML patients in CR.

TI  - Dissection of the Major Hematopoietic Quantitative Trait Locus in Chromosome 6q23.3 
      Identifies miR-3662 as a Player in Hematopoiesis and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
PG  - 1036-51
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-16-0023 [doi]
AB  - Chromosomal aberrations and multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have 
      established a major hematopoietic quantitative trait locus in chromosome 6q23.3. The 
      locus comprises an active enhancer region, in which some of the associated SNPs 
      alter transcription factor binding. We now identify miR-3662 as a new functional 
      driver contributing to the associated phenotypes. The GWAS SNPs are strongly 
      associated with higher miR-3662 expression. Genome editing of rs66650371, a 
      three-base-pair deletion, suggests a functional link between the SNP genotype and 
      the abundance of miR-3662. Increasing miR-3662's abundance increases colony 
      formation in hematopoietic progenitor cells, particularly the erythroid lineage. In 
      contrast, miR-3662 is not expressed in acute myeloid leukemia cells, and its 
      overexpression has potent antileukemic effects in vitro and in vivo Mechanistically, 
      miR-3662 directly targets NF-κB-mediated transcription. Thus, miR-3662 is a new 
      player of the hematopoietic 6q23.3 locus. SIGNIFICANCE: The characterization of 
      miR-3662 has identified a new actor in the prominent hematopoietic quantitative 
      trait locus in chromosome 6q23.3. The mechanistic insights into miR-3662's function 
      may reveal novel or only partially known pathways for normal and malignant 
      hematopoietic cell proliferation. Cancer Discov; 6(9); 1036-51. ©2016 AACR.This

TI  - HDAC Inhibition Induces MicroRNA-182, which Targets RAD51 and Impairs HR Repair to 
      Sensitize Cells to Sapacitabine in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.
PG  - 3537-49
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-1063 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The double-strand breaks elicited by sapacitabine, a clinically active 
      nucleoside analogue prodrug, are repaired by RAD51 and the homologous recombination 
      repair (HR) pathway, which could potentially limit its toxicity. We investigated the 
      mechanism by which histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors targeted RAD51 and HR to 
      sensitize acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells to sapacitabine. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified the role of HDACs in silencing 
      miR-182 in AML. Immunoblotting, gene expression, overexpression, or inhibition of 
      miR-182 and luciferase assays established that miR-182 directly targeted RAD51. HR 
      reporter assays, apoptotic assays, and colony-forming assays established that the 
      miR-182, as well as the HDAC inhibition-mediated decreases in RAD51 inhibited HR 
      repair and sensitized cells to sapacitabine. RESULTS: The gene repressors, HDAC1 and 
      HDAC2, became recruited to the promoter of miR-182 to silence its expression in AML. 
      HDAC inhibition induced miR-182 in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. miR-182 
      targeted RAD51 protein both in luciferase assays and in AML cells. Overexpression of 
      miR-182, as well as HDAC inhibition-mediated induction of miR-182 were linked to 
      time- and dose-dependent decreases in the levels of RAD51, an inhibition of HR, 
      increased levels of residual damage, and decreased survival after exposure to 
      double-strand damage-inducing agents. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings define the mechanism 
      by which HDAC inhibition induces miR-182 to target RAD51 and highlights a novel 
      pharmacologic strategy that compromises the ability of AML cells to conduct HR, 
      thereby sensitizing AML cells to DNA-damaging agents that activate HR as a repair 
      and potential resistance mechanism. Clin Cancer Res; 22(14); 3537-49. ©2016 AACR.
